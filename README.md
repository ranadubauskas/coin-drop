## Theme / Idea

A cozy “tabletop toy” set in a stylized room: the player stands at a table with a piggy bank and loose coins. The goal is to deposit as many coins as possible within a short timer, with satisfying physics, haptics, and sound.

## Core Activity
Pick up coins and drop them through the piggy-bank slot to score.


## Direct Interaction (player-driven)
Grab / distance-grab coins using VR controllers; release to drop or throw.


## Indirect Interaction (player + engine)
Score increases when player drops into the piggy bank slot

## Environment (relevant & minimal)
- Small warm-toned room (walls, floor, soft lighting).
- Central table with piggy bank on a pedestal/cube.
- Simple UI: floating “Coins: N” counter, start/reset buttons on a world-space canvas.



## LLM-assisted Feature
Adding a script to the piggy bank slot to increase score
